It was the [[1956 Summer Olympics|second time]] that the equestrian events were hosted by a member of the IOC other than the member hosting the main games (although this time the events were technically held in the same country as the main games). Unlike [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], however, the equestrian events were part of the main games, and were held within the same period.<ref>{{cite sports-reference |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/2008/EQU/ |title=Equestrianism at the 2008 Beijing Equestrian Games |access-date=10 May 2020 |archive-date=12 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212095722/http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/2008/EQU/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Events ==\n[[File:Beijing2008 HOKETSU Hiroshi.JPG|thumb|right|A Japanese competitor in dressage at the Games]]\n6 sets of medals were awarded in the following events:\n* individual [[dressage]]\n* team dressage\n* individual [[Show jumping|jumping]]\n* team jumping\n* individual [[eventing]]\n* team eventing\n\n== Qualification ==\n{{Details|Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Olympics - Qualification}}\nEach event has its own qualification rules, but generally rely on FEI rankings.\n\n===Dressage qualification===\nFor the team competition there were a total of 10 quota spots and as many composite as qualify.  Three team spots were awarded at the [[2006 FEI World Equestrian Games]].  In addition 7 team spots were awarded at regional competitions (Europe: 3, Americas: 2, Asia: 2).  In addition, should a country have three athletes qualified in the individual competition, they will be considered a team and allowed to compete as a composite team.  Five teams qualified under this scheme.\n\nFor the individual competition, 50 spots were allocated as follows.  Thirty spots were awarded to the athletes who qualified as teams above.  In addition, the highest ranked rider from each of seven geographic regions and the host nation qualify.  Then the top twelve riders based on rank FEI rank who had not otherwise qualified are given spots.\n\n===Jumping qualification===\nA country may send up to five riders if it qualified for the team competition, two otherwise.  Similar to Dressage, teams of five riders were qualified at either the World Equestrian Games, a region competition, or through a composite spot.  The WEG awarded five spots, the regions eight (Americas: 2, Europe: 2, Asia: 4), and two composite teams qualified.  For the individual competition there were a total of 73 spot allocated as follows: 45 team member, 1 host nation, 7 regional, and 22 at-large.\n\n===Eventing qualification===\n{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}\n\n==Officials==\nAppointment of officials was as follows:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inside.fei.org/news/olympic-officials|title=Olympic Officials|date=12 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n;Dressage\n* {{flagicon|GER}} Gotthilf Riexinger (Ground Jury President)\n* {{flagicon|FRA}} Jean-Michel Roudier (Ground Jury Member)\n* {{flagicon|NED}} Ghislain Fouarge (Ground Jury Member)\n* {{flagicon|DEN}} Leif T\u00f6rnblad (Ground Jury Member)\n* {{flagicon|USA}} Gary Rockwell (Ground Jury Member)\n* {{flagicon|JPN}} Minako Furuoka-Hashimoto (Ground Jury Member)\n* {{flagicon|HUN}} Barnabas Mandi (Ground Jury Member)\n* {{flagicon|BEL}} Mari\u00ebtte Withages (Technical Delegate)\n\n;Jumping\n* {{flagicon|NED}} Rogier van Iersel (Ground Jury President)\n* {{flagicon|USA}} David M.

Solier\n|}\n\n== Venue ==\n[[File:Beijing2008 HKB44.JPG|thumb|right|A spectator area and water jump in the eventing portion of the Games]]\nThe equestrian competitions were held apart from the main games in [[Hong Kong]], which is a separate member to the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]]. This was because Hong Kong has established a huge horse racing industry since its British colonial days; therefore, strict quarantine measures for horses have been well established in the region, and were likely to result in fewer problems with equine disease than other cities in mainland China. Additionally, there were already some stabling sites for horses within Hong Kong, hence less construction was needed to facilitate the equestrian sports required by the Olympics.\n\nThere were two main equestrian venues: [[Hong Kong Sports Institute]] (adjacent to [[Sha Tin Racecourse]]) and the [[Beas River Country Club]]. The Sports Institute held the main competition arena, which included an 80 \u00d7 100 meter stadium will all-weather footing and seating for 18,000. The Beas River Country Club was the site of the cross-country phase of [[eventing]], which was held on the golf course.\n\n== Weather ==\n[[File:Beijing2008 HKB27.JPG|thumb|left|An Irish competitor in eventing at the Games]]\nHong Kong is known to have hot and humid weather with [[typhoon]]s being common.<ref>[http://www.hkfastfacts.com/weather/hongkong-weather-aug.html Weather in Hong Kong: August], ''Hong Kong Fast Facts'', accessed 5 December 2008</ref>  This includes a mean air temperature of 28.4&nbsp;\u00b0C (83.1&nbsp;\u00b0F) with 82% humidity, making it even more inclement than Athens (mean temperature of 27.6&nbsp;\u00b0C (81.6&nbsp;\u00b0F), humidity 48%) and Atlanta (26&nbsp;\u00b0C (78&nbsp;\u00b0F), 75% humidity).\n\nSome competitors made it clear that they believed that it would be unfair to work their horses in such weather. Swiss dressage rider [[Silvia Ikl\u00e9|Sylvia Ikle]] was one such rider,<ref>[http://www.eurodressage.com/reports/shows/2008/08og/pr_ikle.html Silvia Ikle Not to Compete at the 2008 Olympic Games] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110072145/http://www.eurodressage.com/reports/shows/2008/08og/pr_ikle.html |date=10 January 2009 }}, 9 January 2008, ''Eurodressage'', accessed 5 December 2008</ref> and the Swiss decided not to send a dressage team because they would have had little chance of success without her.<ref>[http://www.eurodressage.com/reports/shows/2008/08og/pr_swiss.html Swiss Dressage Team Withdraws from Competing at the 2008 Olympics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110092018/http://www.eurodressage.com/reports/shows/2008/08og/pr_swiss.html |date=10 January 2009 }}, 8 January 2008, ''Eurodressage'', accessed 5 December 2008</ref>\n\nTo combat the heat, the horses were transported from the airport in Hong Kong to the stabling facilities in air-conditioned vans. The stables are all air-conditioned as well, at a temperature of 20&nbsp;\u00b0C (68&nbsp;\u00b0F). For the first time in history, there was also an indoor arena for training that was also air-conditioned. Misting fans were placed under tents at both venues to cool off horses that worked outside. There were also vast quantities of ice water available. There was a veterinary clinic on site, which tested the horses' urine several times to ensure they were all properly hydrated.\n\nThe cross-country course was also designed with a shorter, alternate route to be used if the heat and humidity warranted it. The show jumping was held under lights at night to avoid the heat. The footing is made of high tensile fibers and quartz sand, which has a great ability to absorb water, so that any rain should have minimal effect on the footing used for dressage and show jumping competitions.\n\n== Courses ==\n[[File:Lantinus and Lynch.jpg|thumb|right|[[Denis Lynch]] and Latinus in show jumping]]\nThe show jumping courses (both Grand Prix and the eventing stadium phase) were designed by Leopoldo Palacios of Venezuela and Steve Stephens of the USA. Michael Etherington-Smith of Great Britain designed the cross-country course.\n\n== Participation ==\nMore than 200 horses from 41 nations competed.\n*Dressage: 13 teams of 3 riders each, and 10 individuals.\n*Eventing: 5 riders per team, with only 3 scores counting.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Equestrian at the 2008 Summer Paralympics]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060331010211/http://www.beijing2008.com/ Beijing 2008]\n*[http://www.equestrian2008.org/ Beijing 2008 Equestrian]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061205031210/http://horsesport.org/ Federation Equestre Internationale]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20080528140514/http://www.fei.org/Events/Olympic_Games/Documents/2008CompetitionScheduleJuly2007.pdf FEI Official Competition Timetable]\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons category|Equestrian sports at the 2008 Summer Olympics}}\n* {{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20081224081227/http://www.equineonline.net/equestrian-olympics-beijing-2008.php Latest Equestrian News & Results from Beijing 2008]}}\n*[https://digital.la84.org/digital/api/collection/p17103coll8/id/64986/download Equestrian \u2013 Official Results Book]\n\n{{EventsAt2008SummerOlympics}}\n{{Equestrian at the Summer Olympics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Equestrian At The 2008 Summer Olympics}}\n[[Category:Equestrian events at the 2008 Summer Olympics| ]]\n[[Category:Events at the 2008 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Equestrian events at the Summer Olympics|2008]]\n[[Category:International sports competitions hosted by Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:2008 in Hong Kong sport]]\n[[Category:Equestrian sports competitions in Hong Kong]]\n[[Category:2008 in equestrian sports]]"}}}
